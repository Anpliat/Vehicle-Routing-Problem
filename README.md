# Vehicle-Routing-Problem

### Business Scenario
The central warehouse of a company receives many orders from 100 customers. The trucks of the company are based in the central warehouse. The purpose of the assignment is to generate a route for each vehicle with aim to serve all the customers. The route construction is subject to specific constraints. Each route is an open route, which starts from the main warehouse and visits the various customers. The route is terminated at the last customer visited by the vehicle. Each order must be satisfied by one and only one visit of a vehicle, without order splitting. Moreover, each truck has a specific product capacity, hence the truck goods transported must not exceed the maximum capacity of the truck. The vehicles travel at 35 km per hour and the unpacked time of goods is 15 minutes. The 30 trucks which are based in the warehouse are separating in the following categories:

* 15 trucks with a maximum capacity of 1500 kg
* 15 trucks with a maximum capacity of 1200 kg
